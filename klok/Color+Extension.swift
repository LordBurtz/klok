        Time, dissected into perfect squares,
        Where hours hide in geometric snares.
        We built a clock that thinks in grids,
        To show the time that time forbids.
        
        Lines dance where numbers used to be,
        Making simple complexity.
        Why read 3:42 when you can see
        A maze of bars that set time afree?
        
        â€” A clock for those who love to wait
        For it to simply tell you: "late."
