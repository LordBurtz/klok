# GridClock

*Time, dissected into perfect squares,*  
*Where hours hide in geometric snares.*  
*We built a clock that thinks in grids,*  
*To show the time that time forbids.*  

*Lines dance where numbers used to be,*  
*Making simple complexity.*  
*Why read 3:42 when you can see*  
*A maze of bars that set time free?*  

*â€” A clock for those who love to wait*  
*For art to simply tell them: "late."*
